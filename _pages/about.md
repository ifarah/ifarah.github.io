Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in [City & Regional Planning at UC Berkeley](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/city-regional-planning).  \\  
My research revolves mostly around themes of inequality and power, focusing on topics of **urban informality**, **governance**, and **spatial analytics**.

Broadly, my reseach interest is on the management of public space and how different institutions regulate that space. In particular, I am interested in how recent shifts in governance structures and new technologies in Mexico City and San Francisco impact how informal workers, street level bureaucrats, and local politicians negotiate over the use of public space, with a particular focus on street vendors.

Another line of my work studies the retail food environment in Mexico, shedding light on how households purchase from a myriad of food and beverage outlets and the importance of incorporating informal outlets in food policy interventions.

In previous work at the [Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/), I examined the sensitivity of access metrics, the co-location of large chain stores with smaller independent hardware stores, and the demography of firms in the United States by using life tables to analyze the probability at which different firm sizes survived or died over time in different geographies. Currently, I am also involved with [Berkeley's DLab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/) as a Data Science Fellow carrying out R Geospatial and US Census workshops for affiliated members of the University.
