Welcome! I am PhD Candidate in [City & Regional Planning at UC Berkeley](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/city-regional-planning). My research revolves mostly around themes of inequality and power, focusing on topics of urban informality, governance, and spatial analytics.

Broadly, my reseach interest is on the management of public space and how different institutions regulate that space. In particular, I am interested in how recent shifts in governance structures and new technologies in Mexico City and San Francisco impact how informal workers, street level bureaucrats, and local politicians negotiate over the use of public space, with a particular focus on street vendors.
