### The power of street vending associations in Mexico City
Even more, the evolution of street vending associations in their relationship with how the state shapes and controls these associations beyond clientelist practices, and how it has varied across municipalities outside of the Historic Center has not yet been examined. In this context, this project examines the extent to which street vending associations regulate and manage public space.  This project is organized around two main comparisons: (1) a comparison of the politics of street vending outside  subway stations in Mexico City; and (2) an over-time comparison at the city level over the course of three periods of time that cover the rule of three different political parties: pre-1997 (PRI rule); 1997-2018 (Partido Revolucionario Democrático, PRD rule); 2018-today (Movimiento de Regeneración Nacional, MORENA rule).

### The consequences of the street vending ordinance in the Mission District, San Francisco.
The government framed the urgency of creating the street vending ordinance around the conspicuous vending of stolen goods and drugs happening outside the 24th and Mission subway station. However, the street vending ordinance missed its target, implementing regulatory measures for street vendors that were not involved in selling stolen goods or drugs. This study  examines the reaction of vendors, community organizations, and street level bureaucrats (e.g., district supervisors, public works officials, and police officers) to the implementation of the street vending ordinance. In particular, this project traces the dynamism of the implementation and explores the unintended socioeconomic consequences of its implementation at the city level.

### Retail food environment and incorporating informal food outlets in food policies in Mexico
I study the **retail food environment in Mexico**, shedding light on how households purchase from a myriad of food and beverage outlets and the importance of incorporating informal outlets in food policy interventions (jointly with [Dalia Stern] (https://www.globalfoodresearchprogram.org/team/dalia-stern-solodkin/) and other co-authors).

### Firm demography
I examined the sensitivity of **access metrics**, the **co-location** of large chain stores with smaller independent hardware stores, and the **demography of firms** in the United States by using life tables to analyze the probability at which different firm sizes survived or died over time in different geographies (jointly with [Luc Anselin](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/directory/luc-anselin-phd))

### Mobility of informal workers in Mexico City
While cities craft policies to regulate work in the formal labor market, where jobs are more secure, well-remunerated with health and other benefits, cities do not consider regulation of work within the informal labor market. Although street vendors are the most visible form of informal work, little is known about their daily mobility patterns and how that affects their relationship with vendor organizations, street level bureaucrats, and local elected officials. Using the location of informal street markets in Mexico City, I use Call Detail Record (CDR) data to capture people coming into the region of interest (street market) and identify them as vendors, identify their home location, and their mobility patterns across the city. This analysis will allow me to identify the percentage of workers that live within the same municipality in each street market, allowing me to further examine if local workers gain greater political leverage to remain in place through 1) stronger community networks as a more homogeneous group or, 2) by having a stronger clientelistic relationship by being part of the local politicians’ jurisdiction.

### Enumeration of street vendors through satellite images
The existence of street vendors in public space is as contentious as collecting data of their location. The purpose of this research is twofold: 1) to generate an algorithm through computer vision that quantifies fixed street vendors at a large scale; and 2) to carry out analyses between the density of vendors and neighborhood characteristics to assess if the number of people working in public space is associated with socioeconomic status, political party, or the level of presence from vendors’ associations. In order to carry out these analyses I will use images near subway stations from Google Street View and detect street vendors’ stalls by deploying computer vision techniques.


### Development of a teaching curriculum on critical spatial data science
This project examines how to jointly teach critical GIS and technical mapping methods by creating teaching strategies to answer:  
(1)  How to think spatially?  
(2)  How to carry out exploratory spatial analysis?  
(3)  How to incorporate critical thinking using technical tools to examine spatial inequities?
